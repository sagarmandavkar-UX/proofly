## What is Proofly?

Proofly is a free, open-source Chrome extension that brings professional-grade writing assistance directly to your browser—**without compromising your privacy**. Unlike cloud-based alternatives like Grammarly, LanguageTool, or QuillBot, Proofly uses Chrome's Built-in AI APIs to proofread your writing entirely on-device. Your keystrokes never leave your machine.

### The Problems We Solve

Traditional writing assistants require sending your text to remote servers:

- ❌ Your private data travels across the internet
- ❌ Your writing is stored on company servers
- ❌ Requires constant internet connectivity
- ❌ Subject to data breaches and privacy violations
- ❌ Injects excessive UI to the sites you visit
- ❌ Expensive subscription fees

### Our Solution

Proofly runs 100% locally on your device:

- ✅ **Zero data transmission** - Everything stays on your machine
- ✅ **Complete privacy** - No servers, no logs, no tracking
- ✅ **Works offline** - No internet required after model download
- ✅ **Free forever** - Open source, no subscriptions
- ✅ **Lightweight** - Minimal script injection, zero dependencies
- ✅ **User friendly** - Introduces fresh, non-invasive UX patterns
- ✅ **Customizable** - Complete control on how you'd like to get assistance
