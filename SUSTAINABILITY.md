# Proofly Sustainability & Business Model

## Our Commitment

**Proofly will always have a free tier.**

Privacy-first software requires sustainable revenue, but it does NOT require charging every user. We believe in:
1. Free core functionality forever
2. Optional paid features (not paywalls)
3. Student discounts
4. Enterprise/institutional licenses
5. Transparent, user-centric monetization

---

## Current Model: Free & Open Source

### Phase 1 (Now)
- 100% free
- Open source (MIT license)
- Community-driven development
- Donations accepted (voluntary)
- No telemetry or data collection

### Funding
This phase is self-funded or community-supported.

---

## Future Models (Planned)

### Phase 2: Optional Tier (Q4 2026+)

#### Free Tier (Always)
- Basic grammar & clarity checking
- Exam Mode
- One-line explanations
- Passive voice warnings
- Works offline
- No logging

#### Professional Tier (Optional, ~$3-5/month)
- Advanced rewrites (optional cloud processing)
- Readability scoring
- Academic writing mode
- Tone adjustment (formal <-> casual)
- Priority support

**Key point**: Professional tier is completely optional. Free tier is fully functional.

### Phase 3: Student Program
- Free Professional tier for students
- Proof of enrollment required
- No time limit
- Campus/institutional discounts
- Universities can bulk-license for free

### Phase 4: Enterprise Licenses
- Organizations licensing for teams
- Custom integrations
- On-premise deployment option
- Dedicated support
- SLA guarantees

## Why This Model Works

### 1. Privacy-First Paradox Resolved
Cloud-based competitors like Grammarly charge $12-30/month because they monetize data and run expensive servers. Proofly runs locally, so:
- No server costs (except optional cloud features)
- No data to monetize
- Can afford to be free

### 2. Sustainable Revenue
10% of users paying $5/month is enough to maintain and improve Proofly.
- Low operational costs (OSS model)
- Efficient on-device processing
- Community contributions

### 3. Student & Enterprise Focus
Students and institutions are the primary target:
- Students: Want privacy, hate subscriptions → Free tier perfect
- Universities: Want campus-wide tool → Bulk licensing
- Enterprises: Want on-premise → Custom license

## Revenue Projections

### Conservative Estimate
Assuming:
- 10,000 active users (first year)
- 5% conversion to Professional tier ($5/month)
- Average institutional license: $500/year
- 10 institutional customers

**Monthly Revenue**:
- Users paying: 500 x $5 = $2,500
- Institutional (monthly avg): $4,200
- **Total: ~$6,700/month**

**Annual Costs** (minimal):
- Server infrastructure: $500 (CDN, storage)
- Developer time (part-time): $2,000/month
- Miscellaneous: $500/month
- **Total: ~$36,000/year**

**Viability**: With 10K users, revenue covers costs. Upside is significant.

## What We Will NOT Do

### Hard Paywalls
We will NOT:
- Lock core features behind payment
- Charge for bug fixes
- Limit free tier functionality over time
- Add dark patterns (trial expirations, feature limits)
- Sell user data
- Track user behavior
- Require accounts

### Cloud-Only Future
Proofly will always work 100% offline. Optional cloud features (if added) will be truly optional.

### Acquisition Pressure
If acquired, the free tier will remain free. Our acquisition terms (if any) will explicitly protect user privacy.

## Development Sustainability

### Avoiding Burnout
1. **Community Contributions**: GitHub sponsors, code reviews, issue triage
2. **Sustainable Pace**: No "growth at all costs" mentality
3. **Focus**: Do one thing well (clarity + privacy), not everything
4. **Open Source**: Leverage community development

### Long-Term Vision
Proofly should mature to:
- Stable, reliable, minimal maintenance
- Community-maintained core
- Predictable revenue from optional tier
- Institutional licensing as main revenue driver

---

## How Transparency Builds Trust

### This Document
Being public about our business model proves we're not hiding anything.

### Why This Matters
Users can see:
- We're not desperate for revenue (won't add sketchy features)
- We have a long-term plan (won't disappear)
- We care about sustainability (won't burn out)
- We respect privacy (no data monetization)

## FAQ

**Q: Will Proofly always be free?**
A: The core tier will always be free. Advanced features may be optional and paid.

**Q: Will you sell my data?**
A: Never. Our model doesn't require it. We run locally, not on servers.

**Q: What if you get acquired?**
A: Any acquisition terms would protect the free tier and user privacy. If that can't be guaranteed, we'd remain independent.

**Q: How can I help Proofly succeed?**
