# Proofly Features

## Core Feature: Proofly Explains Why

**Every suggestion includes a one-line explanation.** This is the most powerful differentiator.

### Why This Matters
Most tools just correct. Proofly teaches.

**Example:**
Before: "He go to school."
Proofly: "Subject-verb agreement: 'He' (singular) needs 'goes' not 'go'"

**For Students**: Learn why you made the mistake, not just the correction.
**For Non-Native Writers**: Understand English grammar rules as you write.
**For Professionals**: Build confidence in your writing.
